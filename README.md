# Introduction

The content on this wiki will be based off my learning from the books “Learn Functional Programming with Elixir” by Ulisses Almeida and “Programming Elixir 1.6” by Dave Thomas, as well as the Elixir documentation on Hexdocs.

My intentions with this wiki are to help me reset my thinking from being Object-Oriented to Functional. And as a guide that I can use to make a syllabus for creating relevant, real world projects.

The reason I chose to learn Elixir through books is that as a former Quality Assurance Analyst, I don’t have any bad habits in terms of writing my own code, but have a very strong foundation in concepts and comprehension. I fear that if I learn Elixir through projects I copy from online courses, I will pick up the writers habits. With this methodology I will have a purer understanding of the language, and write code in a style that is more representative of my thought process.
